# LLMOps Solutions

This repository contains two solutions for Large Language Model (LLM) operations using AWS services:

1. Amazon Bedrock - For deploying and managing foundation models
2. Amazon SageMaker - For fine-tuning base models to create custom LLM solutions

Both solutions demonstrate end-to-end workflows for building and deploying production-ready LLM applications.

**Note:** The resource deployment process is currently manual and has not been automated through CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions or other source control solutions). Future iterations may include infrastructure-as-code and automated deployment workflows.
